Specific Requirements

VisualizationS must include a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.). 
The project should fall into one of the below four tracks: 

A custom “creative” D3.js project (i.e., a nonstandard graph or chart)

A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly

A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data

A “thick” server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)

The project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.

The project must be powered by a data set with at least 100 records.

The project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).

The final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
